                    An App setting lets you choose between the W Prime Balance DIFFERENTIAL calculation (Froncioni and Clarke - App default, which recovers quicker when power dips below threshold) or the INTEGRAL (Default) calculation (Skiba, et al.). Either setting requires 2 settings - Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and W Prime (in Joules). If your W' Balance goes negative (a breakthrough occurred) the app will automatically adjust your W PRIME and record it in Settings.

                    <p>The app can track when you last did an activity and automatically decay your W Prime setting by a daily percentage. You can set a decay of between 0.1% and 2.5% (between 1 and 25 in App Settings). Example, if my WPrime is 20000 and I set a decay of 5 (equating to 0.5%), then each day of inactivity, my W Prime will decay by 0.5% (in this case, 100J) of the current value. It checks the last activity date and calculates the the new WPrime each App start. If you don't want your W Prime to automatically decay, set the decay to zero (default setting).</p>

                    When I'm training I'm particularly focussed on monitoring Power and ensuring I'm sitting in particular zones. I wanted a single data field that could display everything I needed to know, related to power.

                    **REQUIREMENTS:**
                    
                    ** This data field requires a power meter and cadence sensor to be connected to your Garmin device. **
                    
                    ** There is also a configuration option to display the rear cassette gear, which requires electronic shifting on your bike, linked with your Garmin device. **
                    
                    ** Your data recording interval should be set to 1 second in your Garmin device. That is, not using Smart Recording, and you should TURN OFF auto-pause. Normalised Power and Strava Weighted Power calculations require these settings for accuracy. **
                    
                    
                    See Screen shots, below, for details regarding information and layout.
                    
                    
                    **INFORMATION DISPLAYED:**
                      (depending on device and screen configuration)
                    
                    - Display certain metrics as Bars (default) or Circles.  Unfortunately (due to memory constraints) the Edge520 device cannot display in circles mode.
                    - Battery Status indicator for Edge and Watch devices (except for Edge 520/130, Fenix 5/5x/6) Battery Level: 75-100% Green, 50-75% Blue, 20-50% Orange, less than 20% Red, Level checked every 20 mins and then every 5 mins once below 10%
                    - Current Power Watts (with a configurable 1-30 second moving average)
                    - Average Power, Strava Weighted Average (SWA) Power, or Normalized Power (NP) (option to also display as W/Kg).  If NP is chosen you may also choose to display Intensity Factor (IF) and Training Stress Score (TSS), but only in 1 & 2 field layouts (Edge 130/130+/520+/820/530/830); 1,2 & 3 field layouts (Edge 1000); 1,2, 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B & 7B layouts (Edge 1030) in Circles mode.
                    - Watt Prime Balance (See below)
                    - Power Zone (See below)
                    - Average Power Zone (See below)
                    - Cadence (RPM)
                    - Average cadence (RPM)
                    - Speed, Average Speed and Distance (Kilometres or Miles, depending on Garmin profile)
                    - Gradient %
                    - Rear Cassette gear (for supported devices). Front Chain Ring is also highlighted on Edge 530/830/1000/1030x devices in circles display mode.
                    
                    
                    **POWER ZONES (Coggan - FTP based):**
                    
                    - Z1 = Less than 56% (Recovery - Grey)
                    - Z2 = 56 - 75% (Endurance - Blue)
                    - Z3 = 76 - 90% (Tempo - Green)
                    - Z4 = 91 - 105% (Threshold - Orange)
                    - Z5 = 106 - 120% (Vo2Max - Red)
                    - Z6 = 121 - 150% (Anaerobic - Pink)
                    - Z7 = 151 - MAX% (Neuromuscular - Purple)
                    - Z2 - Z7 are configurable in the App (MAX is derived). The app displays the percentage your power is within the respective zone.
                    
                    
                    **Watt Prime (W') BALANCE:**
                    
                    An App setting lets you choose between the W Prime Balance DIFFERENTIAL calculation (Froncioni and Clarke - App default, which recovers quicker when power dips below threshold) or the INTEGRAL calculation (Skiba, et al.). Either setting requires 2 settings - Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and W Prime (in Joules). If your W' Balance goes negative (a breakthrough occurred) the app will automatically adjust your W PRIME and record it in Settings.
                    
                    - The Watt Prime bar (or circle) will display in Blue for values 50-100%, Orange for values 20-50% and Red for less than 20%.
                    - For a Breakthrough (WP less than zero) it will be the colour purple.
                    - Set W' to zero if not required.
                    
                    
                    **Watt PRIME (W') AUTO DECAY:**
                    
                    The app can track when you last did an activity and automatically decay your W Prime setting by a daily percentage. You can set a decay of between 0.1% and 2.5% (between 1 and 25 in App Settings). Example, if my WPrime is 20000 and I set a decay of 5 (equating to 0.5%), then each day of inactivity, my W Prime will decay by 0.5% (in this case, 100J) of the current value. It checks the last activity date and calculates the the new WPrime each App start. If you don't want your W Prime to automatically decay, set the decay to zero (default setting).
                    
                    
                    **TrainingPower is designed to be used in two-field screen layouts with my other App - TrainingHR.**
                    
                    
                    # What’s New
                    
                    **v1.8.8:**
                    - Remove useUpdateInterval function which was a yes/no setting that allowed the app to only update the Power display every interval (1-30 seconds depending on setting) as it causes issues in settings when updating the App
                    - Code optimizations to better support Fenix5 and Forerunner 935
                    
                    **v1.8.7:**
                    - Add new Circles mode Layouts: Layout 4A (Edge 530/830), Layout 3 (Edge 820) and Layouts 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B (Edge 520+)
                    
                    **v1.8.6:**
                    - NEW: Display IF (Intensity Factor) and TSS (Training Stress Score) via App setting BUT only when Normalized Power (NP) Averaging has also been set.  Please note, IF and TSS are only available in 1 & 2 field layouts (Edge 130/130+/520+/820/530/830); 1,2 & 3 field layouts (Edge 1000); 1,2, 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B & 7B layouts (Edge 1030)
                    - FIX:  Improve the smoothing speed and reactivity of the Filter for the calculation of Gradient (all devices)
                    - Optimise 2 field layout for the Edge1030 device to make it consistent with other layouts
                    
                    **v1.8.5:**
                    - FIX:  If your power output matched your zone 7 power and also matched your maximum power for the activity, the app would crash
                    - FIX:  WPrime balance could show a large negative number in certain situations - such as, high power output for long periods during a long activity
                    - Support the new Garmin AntiAlias feature on supported devices.  With this, graphics are rendered more smoothly, when drawing circles and angular lines
                    - Add FTP setting to the in-app settings function, for supported devices
                    
                    **v1.8.4:**
                    - Add optional (through app settings) battery status indicator for Edge and Watch devices (except for Edge 520/130, Fenix 5/5x/6) Battery Level: 75-100% Green, 50-75% Blue, 20-50% Orange, less than 20% Red - Level checked every 20 mins and then every 5 mins once below 10%.
                    - Added New Circles Mode B for Edge devices (except Edge520/130) - Displays Watt Prime as the bar within the left, main Power circle and Average Power (whichever calculation you chose) as the right, large circle.
                    - Power Zone calculation optimisations
                    
                    **v1.8.3:**
                    - No longer need to supply a Maximum Power setting in App Properties, this is now derived.
                    
                    **v1.8.2:**
                    - NEW: Getting ready to support "In App Settings" (that is, not having to use Garmin Connect or your phone to change App settings). This is currently device firmware dependent, to which Garmin does not provide advice on which devices will receive firmware updates or when updates will be made available. Currently, only the Fenix6, D2 and MARQ devices have the firmware to support this functionality. I'm hopeful the Edge devices (at least some) will soon too. Once a device receives a firmware update that supports in app settings, Training Power "In App Settings" will just start working.
                    - NEW: W Prime Automatic decay (via App Setting)
                    - Support for new Forerunner 745 device
                    - Improve efficiency of drawing circles and ARCs
                    - Improve accuracy of Strava Weighted Average and Normalized Power calculations
                    - Remove App specific LAP function (from All devices except: original Edge 520, original Fenix5 and FR935) as Garmin and Strava do this better
                    
                    **v1.7.5.2:**
                    - Fix: Distance display now follows the units selected in your Garmin Profile (Metric or Imperial)
                    
                    **v1.7.5.1:**
                    - Fix: TrainingPower can only support 1 and 2 field layouts on on Fenix5, Fenix6 and FR935 specific devices due to memory constraints.
                    - Highlight downhill gradient green in Edge devices using Circles mode.
                    
                    **v1.7.5.0:**
                    - Increase the font size in use for Average Power and Average Cadence in Circles view on supported Edge devices.
                    - Compiled under v3.2.1 of Connect IQ SDK
                    
                    **v1.7.4.0:**
                    - Added Settings option to display Normalized Power (isoPower) All supported devices except original Edge 520, FR935 and Original Fenix5. Normalized power will only begin to display 30 seconds after an activity starts.
                    - Standardize colours used to be from 64 colour pallette (except Edge130, which is only Black and White)
                    - Fix an issue with W/Kg calculation on Average Power
                    
                    **v1.7.3.0:**
                    - Added support for Edge 130/130+ with the following caveats: 1) There are no colours, black and white only - as such the datafield now displays the Power Zones (as numbers - "PowerZone : AvgPowerZone"); 2) There is no support for di2 (so no di2 gears will be displayed); and 3) The datafield only suppoprts circles mode.
                    - Remove superfluous Power Z1 setting from App settings.                  </div>

                    When I'm Base Training I'm very focussed on monitoring Heart Rate and ensuring I'm sitting in particular zones. I wanted a single datafield that could display everything I needed to know, related to Heart Rate - that being: HR, HR zone and where I am in that zone, average HR, Average HR zone and Max HR.
                    
                    REQUIREMENTS:
                    
                    This data field displays a number of Heart Rate related values and as such, requires a Heart Rate sensor to be connected to your Garmin device.
                    
                    ** The data field has been optimised for full-width display on Garmin Edge type devices. **
                    
                    **CIRCLES or BARS?:**
                    
                    There is a configuration option in the App Settings that will display the HR zone range and Average HR Zone range as circles instead of the default bars, as per the screen shots.  Unfortunately (due to memory constraints) the Edge520 device cannot display in circles mode.
                    
                    **DISPLAY FIELDS:**
                    
                    - Heart Rate (BPM)
                    
                    - HR Zone (as per HR Zones note, below)
                    
                    - Maximum HR (during this activity)
                    
                    - Average HR (BPM)
                    
                    - Average HR Zone (as per HR Zones note, below)
                    
                    - Time of Day (available in larger screen configurations)
                    
                    - Elapsed Time (available in larger screen configurations)
                    
                    - Rolling 60 second HR Histogram (Available for Edge 130/130+/530/830/1030x/1000 devices)
                    
                    **GARMIN PROFILE?:**
                    
                    An App Setting lets you choose whether you want to use the HR Zone settings you've defined within your Garmin Profile OR the zones you define within the App Settings. If you choose your Garmin Profile there is no need to provide values for the HR Zones, LTHR, HRR, MaxHR and the Zone Type in the App Settings, you can leave these blank.
                    
                    **HR ZONES:**
                    
                    You can define up to 5 HR zones in the App Settings. The zones can be based on Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR), Maximum Heart Rate (MAXHR), or Heart Rate Reserve (HRR). You must choose which Target HR is the basis for your zones in the App Settings.
                    
                    The Zones will default to the standard Coggan zones, which you can adjust. The standard Coggan HR zones are as follows:
                    
                    - Z1 = Less than 68% (Recovery - Grey)
                    - Z2 = 68 - 83% (Endurance - Blue)
                    - Z3 = 84 - 94% (Tempo - Green)
                    - Z4 = 95 - 105% (Threshold - Orange)
                    - Z5 = 106 - MAX (VO2Max - Red)
                    
                    **TrainingHR is designed to be used in two-field screen layouts with my other App - TrainingPower.**

                    - Added support for Garmin Edge 1030+ devices
                    - New Circles layouts for configurations 2, 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B layouts for Edge 1030/1030Bont/1030+
                    - New circles layouts for 2 datafield display in Edge 530/830
                    - New circles layouts for 2 & 3 datafield display in Edge 1000
                    - Added rolling 60 second HR histogram to the new Circles configuration for Edge 530/830/1030x/1000 devices (new property to activate this in settings - default is off)

                    - Add 4 field display options to supported wearable devices
                    - Add LAP function. This works differently to a standard LAP function as I see the main problem with a standard LAP function is what if you want to revert back to Average HR for the entire activity? You can't. With my LAP function when you press the LAP button it starts calculating and displaying average HR from that point - a red "LAP" icon is displayed on screen - When you press the LAP button again, the display reverts back to showing Average HR for the entire activity. This way you can ride out to the bottom of a hill, press the LAP button and see your average HR up the hill, when you get to the top of the hill you can hit the LAP button again and revert to showing average HR for the entire activity. You can do this as many times as you like in an activity. You can also turn off the app's ability to respond to the LAP button in app settings.                  </div>

                    There are a lot of great watch faces on the Garmin app store and I have a few favourites. However, I couldn't find one that had everything I wanted, so I created this one. Key aspects:
                    
                    1) Displays the battery remaining as the tick marks around the watch face - in a choice of two formats - lines or circles - and choice of colour.
                    
                    2) Displays a second hand if watch hardware permits (1hz). Second hand can be triggered to stop displaying by making it the same colour as watchface background.
                    
                    3) Displays 3 dials, one of which can be configured to display Calories (and percentage of calorie target), Altitude, or distance moved today, but also the ability to cycle between these three displays. Dial display cycle will occur every 20 seconds in full-power mode, or every minute in low-power mode. The gauge hand in the dials can be turned off by making it the same colour as the dial background colour.
                    
                    4) Can be configured to reduce data displayed when in "Do Not Disturb" mode, watch not being worn, or when HR is below resting heart rate (within 5%). By reducing data display in this way, battery life can be conserved during periods when the watch isn't in active use (like, when it's not on your wrist, or you might be asleep). Resting Heart rate comes from your Garmin profile, or if it is not set, then Max HR divided by 3. When configured to reduce display based on resting HR, if you're wearing the watch, your HR needs to be less than Resting HR + 5% for 5 or more minutes. If you're not wearing the watch its 30 seconds.
                    
                    5) There are 22 different colour settings that can be applied to the watch face, with colours chosen from the available 64 palette colours, as per the attached image. The attached colour palette shows 64 numbered colours. Just enter this number (1-64) into the colour fields in settings. Please be aware that colours on the watch face will not be as vibrant as those in the colour palette, due to the backlight differences between watch and computer.

                    6) Displays a graph showing your steps history (from left to right, with left being yesterday and the next to the right being the day before yesterday, and so on). The graph highlights when your steps were above your goal for the day.
                    
                    7) Displays Floors climbed graphic as an ARC between 7 and 8 on the watch face. The display shows floors climbed as a percentage of goal. The number of floors climbed is also displayed in the Steps dial (above the steps count), once some floors have actually been climbed.
                    
                    8) Shows the current day number of the month as well as a Phone connected icon, an alarm icon (if you've set an alarm this icon will display) and a "do not disturb" icon which displays when in do not disturb mode.
                    
                    9) The HR dial shows HR as well as percentage of maximum HR, if you've defined this in your Garmin profile or created any heart rate zones. if no maximum HR is set it will default to using the old standard "220 - your age", so long as your age is set in your Garmin profile.
                    
                    10) The steps dial shows steps as well as percentage of steps goal.
                    
                    NOTES:
                    
                    - All the functionality of this watch face will no doubt drain the battery more than a simple watch face that just shows the time (or the Garmin watch faces that are not developed in Connect IQ). Please be aware of that and make use of the battery saving functions.
                    
                    - If after updating from an earlier release of this watch face it stops working, please uninstall and install again
                    
                    - If you are experiencing app crashes, please ensure you have updated to the latest firmware on your device. The app crashes are due to a known issue in the Garmin SDK that occurs with older firmware.
                    
                    - Support for other watch devices coming soon...
